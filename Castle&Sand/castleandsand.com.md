Castle&Sand has been laser-focused on broadening our customer base. Recently, though, we have been getting a lot of attention. All this extra attention has brought along some unwelcome visitors- cyber attackers! That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve hired you! To help keep us safe!

Like all good companies, Castle&Sand collects log data about the activity performed on the corporate network. These security audit logs are stored in Azure Data Explorer (ADX) - a data storage service in Azure (Microsoft‚Äôs cloud). You will use the Kusto Query Language (KQL) to parse through various types of security logs. By analysing these logs, you can help us determine whether we‚Äôre being targeted by malicious actors.

You can find full documentation on ADX here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/tutorial?pivots=azuredataexplorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/tutorial?pivots=azuredataexplorer)

### Objectives

üß† By the end of your first day on the job, you should be able to:

-   Use Azure Data Explorer and Kusto Query Language
-   Use multiple data sets to answer targeted questions 
-   Investigate cyber activity in logs including: email, web traffic, and server logs 
-   Use multiple techniques to track the activity of APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)

## Section 1: The Walkthrough 

#### Getting Set Up in Azure Data Explorer (ADX)

ADX is the primary tool used in the Castle&Sand SOC for data exploration and analysis. The great thing about ADX is that it is used by cyber analysts at many of the smallest and largest organizations in the world. 

Let‚Äôs get you logged in and started with ADX:

1. Go to the Castle&Sand training module at [kc7cyber.com/castle-and-sand](http://kc7cyber.com/castle-and-sand)

On the training module page, you‚Äôll see a button that says **Get the Data**. Click this and it will redirect you to ADX! (Note: You‚Äôll probably be asked to login with a Microsoft account. You can use an existing personal or organization-issued Microsoft account, or create a new one for free.)

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XVuNwIMKtT5WtYaxLkPRnuezZQfpWBDNa8naLYn31uFLDyd2A8NxrXYK86Vf9wEkdwuMM3Sp0PDdS9T3LXkeWJLYd2w_OVr39dB17_T-ItxDycIdURHQ74vMNQ-zMHVWJIsXeeuFjhoV)

Once you login, you should see a cluster called  _‚Äúkc7cyber.eastus2‚Äù_   has already been added to your account.

![image](https://github.com/KC7-Foundation/kc7_data/assets/129029167/33983641-1dab-4c4d-8dac-0b65532d3b4f)

Data in ADX is organized in a hierarchical structure which consists of **clusters**, **databases**, and **tables**.

![image](https://github.com/KC7-Foundation/kc7_data/assets/129029167/08cfad5e-f136-4e72-a87b-514d6886b484)

All of Castle&Sand‚Äôs security logs are stored in a single database ‚Äì the CastleSand database. 

  2. Select your database.  
	- Expand the dropdown arrow next to the Castle&Sand database.
	- Click on the **CastleSand** database. Once you‚Äôve done this, you should see the database highlighted- this means you‚Äôve selected the database and are ready to query the tables inside.

Note: It‚Äôs very important that you use the Castle&Sand database for all questions while you‚Äôre investigating activity at Castle&Sand! If you choose the wrong database, you won‚Äôt be able to answer questions correctly.

The big space to the right of your cluster list is the _query workspace_. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll actually write the queries used to interact with our log data.

![image](https://github.com/KC7-Foundation/kc7_data/assets/129029167/648ed512-51a3-4c46-a298-1e1d14514b91)

Currently, you‚Äôll see there‚Äôs a message there welcoming you to Castle&Sand! Click the blue Run button above the query workspace to run your first query! Once you‚Äôve done that, you can erase the welcome message by highlighting it and pressing backspace or delete on your keyboard.

Okay, enough introductions‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs get your hands on the data.

#### First Look at the data... 

The **CastleSand** database contains nine tables. Tables contain many rows of similar data. For security logs, a single row typically represents a single thing done by an employee or a device on the network at a particular time.

We currently have nine types of log data. As you‚Äôll see in ADX, each log type corresponds to a table that exists in the **CastleSand** database:

| **Table Name** | **Description** | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Employees | Contains information about the company‚Äôs employees| 
| Email | Records emails sent and received by employees|
| InboundNetworkEvents | Records inbound network events including browsing activity from the Internet to devices within the company network|
| OutboundNetworkEvents | Records outbound network events including browsing activity from within the company network out to the Internet|
| AuthenticationEvents | Records successful and failed logins to devices on the company network. This includes logins to the company‚Äôs mail server.|
| FileCreationEvents | Records files stored on employee‚Äôs devices|
| ProcessEvents | Records processes created on employee‚Äôs devices |
| PassiveDns (External) | Records IP-domain resolutions |
| SecurityAlerts | Records security alerts from an employee‚Äôs device or the company‚Äôs email security system |

> üéØ**Key Point ‚Äì Over the Horizon (OTH) data**: One of the tables listed above is not like the others ‚Äì **PassiveDns**. Rather than being an internal security log, PassiveDns is a data source that we‚Äôve purchased from a 3rd party vendor. Not all malicious cyber activity happens within our company network, so sometimes we depend on data from other sources to complete our investigations.


You‚Äôll learn more about how to use each of these datasets in just a minute. First, let‚Äôs just run some queries so you can practice using KQL and ADX.


#### KQL 101 

Type the following query in the workspace to view the first rows in the **Employees** table. Press ‚Äúrun‚Äù or ‚Äúshift + enter‚Äù to execute the query.

```sql
Employees
| take 10
```

This query has a few parts. Let‚Äôs take a moment to break each of them down:

![Diagram
Description automatically generated with low confidence](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/y7YpmVbUlak4wMrI43nYzAqieamRnwiANLJzy8UsxHHaYJI5SlJVpTdz4EO47A-g0SVI77ehgZxHB13AZXLKKX02Yr40VZmFsb3blZgHCojeD-vS34SS24yWWqK6rnduGNdhmnXlCAQAMWETrm7_hg)

| **Query Component** | **Description** | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Table Name | The table name specifies which table/data source the query will pull data from. All queries must start with a table.|
| Pipe character (&#124;) | The pipe character indicates the start of a new part of the query. A pipe will be added automatically after typing a table name and pressing enter. You can also add a pipe character manually by holding shift and pressing the backslash (&#92;) key. That‚Äôs the one just below the backspace key.

The **take** operator is a powerful tool you can use to explore rows in a table, and therefore better understand what kinds of data are stored there.

> üéØ**Key Point ‚Äì What to do when you don‚Äôt know what to do**: Whenever you are faced with an unfamiliar database table, the first thing you should do is sample its rows using the **take** operator. That way, you know what fields are available for you to query and you can guess what type of information you might extract from the data source.


The Employees table contains information about all the employees in our organization. In this case, we can see that the organization is named ‚ÄúCastle&Sand‚Äù and the domain is ‚Äúcastleandsand.com‚Äù.

> 1. ü§î Try it for yourself! Do a **take** 10 on all the other tables to see what kind of data they contain.

Make sure you record your answer to all the questions from KQL 101 in the scoreboard at kc7cyber.com/scoreboard

You can easily write multiple queries in the same workspace tab. To do this, make sure to separate each query by an empty line. Notice below how we have separated the queries for the **Employees**, **Email**, and **OutboundNetworkEvents** tables by adding empty lines between them.

```sql
Email
| take 10

Employees
| take 10

OutboundNetworkEvents
| take 10
```

When you have multiple queries, it‚Äôs important to tell ADX which query you want to run. To choose a query, just click on any line that is part of that query. 

**Finding Out ‚ÄúHow Many‚Äù: The count Operator**

We can use **count** to see how many rows are in a table. This tells us how much data is stored there.

```sql
Employees
| count
```

> 2.  ü§îHow many employees are in the company?

**Filtering Data With the _where_ Operator**

So far, we‚Äôve run queries that look at the entire contents of the table. Often in cybersecurity analysis, we only want to look at data that meets a set of conditions or criteria. To accomplish this, we apply filters to specific columns.
  
We can use the **where** operator in KQL to apply filters to a particular field. For example, we can find all the employees with the name ‚ÄúJason‚Äù by filtering on the name column in the Employees table.

**where** statements are written using a particular structure. Use this helpful chart below to understand how to structure a **where** statement.

| **where** | **field** | **operator** | **"value"** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| where | name | has | "Jason" |

```sql
Employees
| where name has "Jason"
```

The **has** operator is useful here because we‚Äôre looking for only a partial match. If we wanted to look for an employee with a specific first and last name (an exact match), we‚Äôd use the == operator:

```sql
Employees
| where name == "Jason Goldsmith"
```

> 3. ü§îEach employee at Castle&Sand is assigned an IP address. Which employee has the IP address: ‚Äú10.10.2.1‚Äù?

Here are some additional operators we like to use:

| Operator | Description | Case-Sensitive | Example (yields true) |
|---|---|---|---|
| == | Equals | Yes | "aBc" == "aBc" |
| != | Not equals | Yes | "abc" != "ABC" |
| =~ | Equals | No | "abc" =~ "ABC" |
| contains | Right-hand-side (RHS) occurs as a subsequence of left-hand-side (LHS) | No | "FabriKam" contains "BRik" |
| has | RHS is a whole term in LHS | No | "North America" has "america" |
| has_all | Same as has but works on all of the elements | No | "North and South America" has_all("south", "north") |
| has_any | Same as has but works on any of the elements | No | "North America" has_any("south", "north") |
| in | Equals to any of the elements | Yes | "abc" in ("123", "345", "abc") |


While performing their day-to-day tasks, Castle&Sand employees send and receive emails. A record of each of these emails is stored in the **Email** table.

> üéØ**Key Point ‚Äì User Privacy and Metadata**: As you can imagine, some emails are highly sensitive. Instead of storing the entire contents of every email sent and received within the company in a database that can be easily accessed by security analysts, we only capture email metadata. 

Email metadata includes information like: the time the email was sent, the sender, the recipient, the subject line, and any links the email may contain. Storing only email metadata, rather than entire contents, helps protect the privacy of our employees, while also ensuring that our security analysts can keep us safe. Sometimes even metadata can reveal sensitive information, so it‚Äôs important that you don‚Äôt talk about log data with other employees outside the SOC.


We can find information about the emails sent or received by a user by looking for their email address in the sender and recipient fields of the **Email** table. For example, we can use the following query to see all the emails sent by ‚ÄúJason Goldsmith‚Äù:

```sql

Email
| where sender == "jason_goldsmith@castleandsand.com"

```

> 4. ü§îHow many emails did Jacqueline Henderson receive?

**Easy as 1, 2, 3‚Ä¶ Compound Queries and the distinct Operator**

We can use the **distinct** operator to find unique values in a particular column. We can use the following query to determine how many of the organization‚Äôs users sent emails.

```sql
Email
| where sender has "castleandsand.com"
| distinct sender
| count
```

This is our first time using a multi-line query with multiple operators, so let‚Äôs break it down:

In line 2, we take the Email table and filter the data down to find only those rows with ‚Äúcastleandsand.com‚Äù in the sender column.

In line 3, we add another pipe character ( | ) and use the distinct operator to find all the unique senders. Here, we aren‚Äôt finding the unique senders for all of the email senders, but only the unique senders that are left after we apply the filter looking for rows with ‚Äúcastleandsand.com‚Äù in the sender column.

Finally, in line 4, we add another pipe character ( | ) and then use the count operator to count the results of lines 1-3 of the query.

> 5. ü§î How many distinct senders were seen in the email logs from sunandsandtrading.com?

**Tracking Down a Click: OutboundNetworkEvents Data**

When employees at Castle&Sand browse to a website from within the corporate network, that browsing activity is logged. This is stored in the **OutboundNetworkEvents** table, which contains records of the websites browsed by each user in the company. Whenever someone visits a website, a record of it is stored in the table. However, the user‚Äôs name is not stored in the table, only their IP address is recorded. There is a 1:1 relationship between users and their assigned IP addresses, so we can reference the **Employees** table to figure out who browsed a particular website. When a user visits a site, sometimes data from a lot of other sources are loaded as well. For example, images, assets, and other content may be hosted on content delivery network (CDN), which is used to deliver and load content quickly on a website. Sometimes, advertisements will also load from a particular website as well.

If we want to figure out what websites Cristin Genao visited, we can find their IP address from the Employees table.

```sql
Employees
| where name == "Cristin Genao"
```

The query above tells us their IP address is ‚Äú10.10.0.84‚Äù. We can take their IP address and look in the **OutboundNetworkEvents** table to determine what websites they visited.

```sql
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip == "10.10.0.84"
```

> 6. ü§î How many unique websites did ‚ÄúCristin Genao‚Äù visit?


**What‚Äôs in a Name? All about Passive DNS Data**

Although domain names like ‚Äúgoogle.com‚Äù are easy for humans to remember, computers don‚Äôt know how to handle them. So, they convert them to machine readable IP addresses. Just like your home address tells your friends how to find your house or apartment, an IP address tells your computer where to find a page or service hosted on the internet.

> üéØ**Key Point ‚Äì Practice Good OPSEC**: If we want to find out which IP address a particular domain resolves to, we could just browse to it. But, if the domain is a malicious one, you could download malicious files to your corporate analysis system or tip off the attackers that you know about their infrastructure. As cybersecurity analysts, we must follow procedures and safeguards that protect our ability to track threats. These practices are generally called operational security, or OPSEC.

To eliminate the need to actively resolve (that is- directly browse to or interact with a domain to find it‚Äôs related IP address) every domain we‚Äôre interested in, we can rely on passive DNS data. Passive DNS data allows us to safely explore domain-to-IP relationships, so we can answer questions like:

-   *Which IP address does this domain resolve to?*
-   *Which domains are hosted on this IP address?*
-   *How many other IPs have this domain resolved to?*

These domain-to-IP relationships are stored in our **PassiveDns** table.

> 7. ü§î How many domains in the PassiveDns records contain the word ‚Äúshark‚Äù? (hint: use the contains operator instead of has. If you get stuck, do a take 10 on the table to see what fields are available.)
> 8. ü§î What IPs did the domain ‚Äúsharkfin.com‚Äù resolve to (enter any one of them)?

**ü§ØLet statements ‚Äì making your life a bit easier:**

Sometimes we need to use the output of one query as the input for a second query.  The first way we can do this is by manually typing the results into the next query.

For example, what if we want to look at all the web browsing activity from employees named ‚ÄúJames‚Äù?

First, you would need to go into the **Employees** table and find the IP addresses used by these employees.


```sql
Employees
| where name has "James"
```

![image](https://github.com/KC7-Foundation/kc7_data/assets/129029167/9565f7fc-9008-45fa-9439-9a35a910f5e1)

Then, you could manually copy and paste these IPs into a query against the **OutboundNetworkEvents** table. Note that we can use the in operator to choose all rows that have a value matching any value from a list of possible values. In other words, the == (comparison) operator looks for an exact match, while the in operator checks for any values from the list

```sql 
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where src-ip in ("10.10.3.102",
	"10.10.3.48",
	"10.10.4.37",
	"10.10.2.143",
	"10.10.2.143",
	"10.10.3.155",
	"10.10.5.180",
	"10.10.1.178",
	"10.10.5.67",
	"10.10.1.221")
```

Although this is a valid way to get the information you need, it may not be as elegant (or timely) if you had 100 or even 1000 employees named ‚ÄúJames.‚Äù

We can accomplish this in a more elegant way by using a [let statement,](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/letstatement) which allows us to assign a name to an expression or a function. We can use a let statement here to save and give a name to the results of the first query so that the values can be re-used later. That means we don‚Äôt have to manually type or copy and paste the results repeatedly.

```sql 
let james_ips = 
Employees
| where name has "James"
| distinct ip_addr;
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip in (james_ips)
```

On the left of the let statement is the variable name (‚Äújames_ips‚Äù in this case). The variable name can be whatever we want, but it is helpful to make it something meaningful that can help us remember what values it is storing.

```sql  hl_lines="1"
let james_ips = 
Employees
| where name has "James"
| distinct ip_addr;
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip in (james_ips)
```
On the right side of the let statement in the expression you are storing. In this case, we use the **distinct** operator to select values from only one column ‚Äì so they are stored in an array ‚Äì or list of values.

```sql  hl_lines="2 3 4"
let james_ips = 
Employees
| where name has "James"
| distinct ip_addr;
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip in (james_ips)
```

The **let** statement is concluded by a semi-colon.

```sql  hl_lines="4"
let james_ips = 
Employees
| where name has "James"
| distinct ip_addr;
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip in (james_ips)
```

After we store the value of a query into a variable using the **let** statement, we can refer to it as many times as we like in the rest of the query. The stored query does not show any output. Remember, however, that your KQL query must have a tabular statement ‚Äì which means that you must have another query following your **let** statement.

> 9. ü§î How many unique URLs were browsed by employees named ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù?

> üéØ**Key Point ‚Äì Pivoting:** Part of being a great cyber analyst is learning how to use multiple data sources to tell a more complete story of what an attacker has done. We call this ‚Äúpivoting.‚Äù We pivot by taking one known piece of data in one dataset and looking in a different dataset to learn something we didn‚Äôt already know. You practiced this here when we started in one dataset ‚Äì the Employees table ‚Äì and used knowledge from there to find related data in another source ‚Äì OutboundNetworkEvents.


## Section 2: Start Hunting! 

You‚Äôve finished your training and you‚Äôre ready to get to work protecting Castle&Sand. 

Work with your team to complete as many challenge questions from the remaining sections in the scoreboard as possible! The goal is to score as many points as you can. There are a lot of questions (the attackers have been busy), so you probably won‚Äôt be able to answer them all. Just do as many as you can!

As you answer the questions, we will take you on a journey exploring the data and discovering what actions the adversaries have taken. However, you should remember that this is only one of many paths you can take through the data.  As you go, don‚Äôt forget to pay attention to the details along the way. What patterns do the attackers exhibit that could help you track them better? Do they like to use certain words, themes? Or do they make mistakes? Keeping track of these patterns will help you build the full picture of what happened. 

Use the provided [Actor Preview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZR4eVG886oPziG-5nGeQ5kN_q5Bpq0m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105873493764084037775&rtpof=true&sd=true) document to keep track of what you know about the attacker. Building a good profile, timelining the attacker‚Äôs activity, and forming a list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) will help you keep track of the attacker. KC7 models some of the techniques used by these attackers from real world threat actors, so it may be a helpful resource for you in the future when you are investigating a real security incident. 

Now, get out there and keep us safe! The whole company is counting on you. No pressureüòä.

## Nice to Know

Here are some things that might be helpful to know as we explore the CastleSand Database:

#### Business hours

We operate our business from 9am to 5pm, 7 days a week. We should roughly expect to see all legitimate business activity within that timeframe (with some exceptions, of course). Let's be vigilant about any activity that occurs on the network while everyone sleeps ;)

#### Pay attention to the IT Workers

Our IT staff at Castle&Sand are granted elevated privileges on machines across the company in order to fulfill their duties. As a result, it can be concerning when their machines get compromised. We, at Castle&Sand, are a security-aware organization, so we do not grant local administrative privileges to users on their computers. However, each laptop and desktop at Castle&Sand is provisioned with a separate local administrative account - which looks something like "marketing_local_admin." These administrator accounts are provisioned with the same username and password per department. For example, all employees in the Marketing department have a local administrator account with the username "marketing_local_admin" and the same password.

#### Castle&Sand uses Active Directory

We utilize Active Directory, a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows networks. It provides us with a centralized and standardized system for managing and organizing network resources, such as user accounts, computers, groups, and other network objects.

Unfortunately, compromising the Active Directory Domain Controller would give an adversary credentials for all accounts on our network and enable them to cause severe harm.

#### Alerts and Alert Fatigue

In the CastleSand database, we have access to a **SecurityAlerts** table that shows suspicious security events that have occurred on the Castle&Sand network. This can be a great place to begin searching for malicious activity. However, we need to be aware that some of these alerts are false positives, which means they may indicate non-malicious activity. Let's be careful not to waste too much time chasing after these.


## Mitre ATT&CK Techniques

The following Mitre ATT&CK techniques were used my by the actors in the observed intrusions

### Reconnaissance
- **T1594** - Search Victim-Owned Websites:
Adversaries may search websites owned by the victim for information that can be used during targeting. Victim-owned websites may contain a variety of details, including names of departments/divisions, physical locations, and data about key employees such as names, roles, and contact info (ex: Email Addresses). These sites may also have details highlighting business operations and relationships.

### Resource Development
- **T1584** - Compromise Infrastructure:
Adversaries may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web and DNS services. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary lifecycle.

### Initial Access
- **T1189** - Drive-by Compromise:
Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring Application Access Token.

- **T1566** - Phishing:
Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.

- **T1195** - Supply Chain Compromise:
Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.

### Execution
- **T1047** - Windows Management Instrumentation:
Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malicious commands and payloads.

- **T1053** - Scheduled Task/Job:
Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code.

### Persistence
- **T1574** - Hijack Execution Flow:
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs.

- **T1078** - Valid Accounts:
Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion.

### Privilege Escalation
- **T1078** - Valid Accounts:
Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion.

- **T1484** - Domain Policy Modification:
Adversaries may modify the configuration settings of a domain to evade defenses and/or escalate privileges in domain environments.

### Defense Evasion
- **T1070** - Indicator Removal:
Adversaries may delete or modify artifacts generated within systems to remove evidence of their presence or hinder defenses.

- **T1574** - Hijack Execution Flow:
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs.
