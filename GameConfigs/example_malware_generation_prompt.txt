The following yaml config is used to generate fake data by a malware family called "hiddenburg"
The paths represent suspicious folders on the victim computer where implants will get hiddenburg
the recon_processes represent host and network discovery and enumeration commands executed by the malware to learn more about the victim 
Be creative with the  recon_processes
The c2_processes represent a proesses executre by the malware to establish command and control channel to an adversary IP
Examples of C2 process might include the use of plink, ligolo, c2 over dns,  or other custom protocols
Using this config as an example, generate an malware config for a malware family named 'blackhole'
Show the results in a code spinnet so it can easily be copied and pasted
