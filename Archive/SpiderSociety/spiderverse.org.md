Spider Society has been laser-focused on broadening our customer base. Recently, though, we have been getting a lot of attention. All this extra attention has brought along some unwelcome visitors- cyber attackers! That’s why we’ve hired you! To help keep us safe!

Like all good companies, Spider Society collects log data about the activity our employees perform on the corporate network. These security audit logs are stored in Azure Data Explorer (ADX) - a data storage service in Azure (Microsoft’s cloud). You will use the Kusto Query Language (KQL) to parse through various types of security logs. By analysing these logs, you can help us determine whether we’re being targeted by malicious actors.

You can find full documentation on ADX here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/tutorial?pivots=azuredataexplorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/tutorial?pivots=azuredataexplorer)

### Objectives

🧠 By the end of your first day on the job, you should be able to:

-   Use the Azure Data Explorer
-   Use multiple data sets to answer targeted questions 
-   Investigate cyber activity in logs including: email, web traffic, and server logs 
-   Use multiple techniques to track the activity of APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) 
-   Use third party data sets to discover things about your attackers
-   Make recommendations on what actions a company can take to protect themselves


**The attackers have gotten a head start, so let's not waste any more time... let's get to work!**
