## Section 1: The Walkthrough

EnvolveLabs collects log data about the activity our employees perform on the organization's network. These security audit logs are stored in Synapse - a versatile central intelligence and analysis system developed by the Vertex Project. You will use the Storm query language to pivot through EnvolveLabs‚Äô telemetry, and label clusters of malicious activity you find along the way. By analyzing these logs, you can help us determine whether we‚Äôre being targeted by malicious actors and help us stop the adversaries!

### Getting Set Up in Synapse

A few things you‚Äôll need to do first:

1. If you have not already received a Synapse demo instance, you can request one [here](https://vertex.link/request-a-demo).

2. Once you‚Äôve requested a Synapse demo instance, you will receive an email from ‚ÄúOptic <signup@vertex.link>‚Äù with a link to your Synapse demo instance. Click the link to create a password and log into your Synapse instance.

3. Once you have logged in, you should be in the Research Tool. Verify this by checking the green Top Bar at the top of the UI. It should show ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù in the left-hand corner. Alternatively, navigate to the Research Tool by

4. Use the Workspace Selector dropdown menu in the Top Bar to change from ‚Äúdefault‚Äù to the ‚ÄúKC7 Workspace‚Äù. This will be the first dropdown menu to the right of where it says ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù.

5. After selecting the KC7 Workspace, move to the dropdown menu to the right of the Workspace selector, and select the KC7 Cyberwarcon 2023 view. This is where the data for today‚Äôs exercise is located. The Top Bar of your UI should now have a specific appearance (a visual representation or description would typically follow here).

6. Next, we‚Äôre going to create a scratchspace to work out of. To do this, click the fork icon to the right of the View Selector:

	This will give you a pop-up window where you can name your scratchspace, then click ‚ÄúFork‚Äù to create it. You‚Äôll see the name of your scratchspace replace the ‚ÄúKC7 Cyberwarcon 2023‚Äù view in the View Selector.

7. Double check that the Query Bar, shown below, is set to Storm mode:

	We‚Äôll be using this Query Bar to run our queries for today‚Äôs exercises. 


8. Use the Toolbar on the left of the UI to navigate to the Power-Ups Tool by clicking on the lightning bolt icon. Once in the Power-Ups Tool, use the search bar to search for the Synapse-Alienvault Power-Up in the ‚ÄúAvailable‚Äù tab. Click the ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button to install it on your Synapse Instance:

### First Look at the Data‚Ä¶

EnvolveLabs maintains a log of various events taking place within the company. This data is gathered from multiple sources such as network sensors, firewalls, and endpoint products. This information is pivotal for detecting and countering malicious activities. You can access this data in Synapse using the following forms:

| Form Used           | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ps:contact`        | Information about employees hired at the company and their corresponding assets                      |
| `inet:email:message`| Emails sent and received by employees at the company                                                 |
| `it:host`           | Information about hosts assigned to the company‚Äôs employees                                          |                                                                                     |
| `inet:http:request` | Web browsing activity to and from the Internet, indicating websites visited by our employees and external users browsing our websites |
| `it:logon`          | Successful and failed logins to devices on the company network, including logins to the company‚Äôs mail server |
| `it:exec:file:add`  | Data about one of the employee-assigned host machines adding a file to a filesystem                  |
| `it:exec:proc`      | Data regarding processes created on employee‚Äôs devices                                               |
| `inet:dns:a`        | IP-domain resolutions provided by a third-party vendor                                               |
| `risk:alert`        | Security alerts from employees‚Äô devices and the company‚Äôs email security system                      |

These additional forms may be helpful during your investigations

| Form           | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `inet:fqdn`         | A fully qualified domain name                                                                        |
| `inet:ipv4`         | An IPv4 address 


## STORM 101

There are three basic operations we‚Äôll use to query the company‚Äôs logs using Storm: Lift, Filter, and Pivot. We can build everything on top of these basics. 

### Lift

Lift operations retrieve a set of nodes based on specified criteria. Let‚Äôs try a few lifts to get comfortable using Storm and working with the EnvolveLabs datasets.

<u>Lifts - Example 1: Let‚Äôs find all the employees at EnvolveLabs</u>

To look at all the employees in the EnvolveLabs data, we can use a lift operation. We need to start by typing the Form for the employee object. Here, the form for employees is `ps:contact`.
Enter the following in the Query Bar:

```css
ps:contact
```

We‚Äôll find there are 1,513 results. Each result is a node that represents a unique employee at the company, with more detail about each employee - such as name, email address, and title - captured as a node property.

Question: How many employees are in the company?

<u>**Lifts Example 2: Finding a limited number of nodes**</u>

In Lifts - Example 1, we found all the employees at EnvolveLabs by typing the name of the Form `ps:contact` that corresponds to the employee data model and lifting all `ps:contact` nodes. But, what if we wanted to look at an even larger set of nodes, for instance, all the domains seen in EnvolveLabs data?

As with Example 1, let‚Äôs start by typing the Form name associated with domains:

```css
inet:fqdn
```

This query brings back over 2,000 results. To see a more manageable set of the data, we can pipe the output of the query to the limit command, which will only return the specified numbers of results. Let‚Äôs run this query to see only 10 domains:

```css
inet:fqdn | limit 10
```

>Lift 10 employees. Enter ‚Äúdone‚Äù when you have finished. 

<u>Lifts Example 3: Standard and Extended Comparisons</u>

Lift can do more than just show us all nodes in the hypergraph. Often, we want to use a Storm query to find only specific nodes that meet a given set of criteria. Suppose we wanted to find more information about Envolve Labs employee Stephanie Clark.

We‚Äôll be looking at ps:contact nodes for this query, but this time, we‚Äôll focus specifically on the node‚Äôs :name property. Using the = comparator, we can find the exact node that belongs to Stephanie Clark:

```css
ps:contact:name="Stephanie Clark"
```

If, instead, we wanted to find all EnvolveLabs employees with the first name Stephanie, we could use the prefix comparator `^=` to match these nodes:

```css
ps:contact:name^=Stephanie
```

>What is the CEO‚Äôs name? (hint: lift by the title)


### Filter

Filter operations are performed on the output of a previous Storm operation, such as a lift or pivot. We use filter to downselect the set of nodes by either including or excluding nodes based on a set of criteria:

* `+` specifies an inclusion filter (include only the nodes that match the criteria)
* `-` specifies an exclusion filter (include all nodes except those that match the criteria)


<u>Filters Example 1: Inclusion Filtering</u>

Suppose we wanted to look at all the emails sent by Stephanie Clark, but only those emails about economics.

First, let‚Äôs find Stephanie‚Äôs email, which we can do using a simple lift:

```css
ps:contact:name="Stephanie Clark"
```

Right-click on Stephanie‚Äôs email address from the results table to copy it. Next, we need to identify the form which corresponds to email messages sent to/from the company.

```css
inet:email:message
```

Then, we can use a simple lift to find emails sent by Stephanie:

```css
inet:email:message:from="stephanie_clark@envolvelabs.xyz"
```

Now, we‚Äôve found all emails sent by Stephanie. But, remember, we need to find only those messages about economics. We can add a filter based on the subject line of the email messages to find such emails. In this case, we‚Äôll use an inclusion filter with a regular expression (regex) comparator to look for the term ‚Äúeconomics‚Äù anywhere within the email‚Äôs Subject line:

```css
inet:email:message:from="stephanie_clark@envolvelabs.xyz" +:subject~="economics"
```

This leaves us with only one result.

<u>Filters Example 2: Exclusion Filtering</u>

Let‚Äôs look again at Stephanie‚Äôs emails. But this time, we want to ignore any email that might mention an opinion. For this, we‚Äôll use an exclusion filter:

```css
inet:email:message:from="stephanie_clark@envolvelabs.xyz" -:subject~="opinions"
```

This leaves us 17 results.

### Pivot

Pivot operations are performed on the output of a previous Storm operation such as a lift or filter. Pivot operators are used to navigate from one set of nodes to another based on a specified relationship.

Pivot operations can help us join information together from multiple sources throughout the course of our investigation.

We‚Äôll primarily use the pivot out operator, which is denoted by the arrow symbol `->`

<u>Pivot Out Example 1</u>

Suppose you wanted to find all the links sent in the emails sent by Stephanie Clark. We can accomplish this using the pivot out operator

First, we lift to find emails sent by Stephanie:

```css
inet:email:message:from="stephanie_clark@envolvelabs.xyz" 
```

Then we pivot on those messages to find those that also include embedded links:

```css
inet:email:message:from="stephanie_clark@envolvelabs.xyz" -> inet:email:message:link 
```

Then, we pivot from the inet:email:message:link nodes representing those messages to the inet:url nodes representing just the URLs themselves.

```css
inet:email:message:from="stephanie_clark@envolvelabs.xyz" -> inet:email:message:link -> inet:url
```

Of course, there could have been multiple links that were sent by Stephanie. We can view the unique links by piping the existing query to the `uniq` command. 

```css
inet:email:message:from="stephanie_clark@envolvelabs.xyz" -> inet:email:message:link -> inet:url | uniq
```

## Section 2 Start Hunting!

You‚Äôve finished your training and you‚Äôre ready to get to work protecting EnvolveLabs.

Work with your team to complete as many challenge questions from the remaining sections in the scoreboard as possible! The goal is to score as many points as you can. There are a lot of questions (the attackers have been busy), so you probably won‚Äôt be able to answer them all. Just do as many as you can!

As you answer the questions, we will take you on a journey exploring the data and discovering what actions the adversaries have taken. However, you should remember that this is only one of many paths you can take through the data. As you go, don‚Äôt forget to pay attention to the details along the way. What patterns do the attackers exhibit that could help you track them better? Do they like to use certain words, themes? Or do they make mistakes? Keeping track of these patterns will help you build the full picture of what happened.

Use the provided Actor Preview document to keep track of what you know about the attacker. Building a good profile, timelining the attacker‚Äôs activity, and forming a list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) will help you keep track of the attacker. KC7 models some of the techniques used by these attackers from real world threat actors, so it may be a helpful resource for you in the future when you are investigating a real security incident.

Now, get out there and keep us safe! The whole company is counting on you. No pressureüòä.
